# COMMAND RULES
# ============================================================================
# Rules are processed in priority order (highest priority first).
# The first matching rule determines the action for a message.
#
# Available actions: "delay", "block", "forward", "modify"
# Available message_type: "COMMAND_LONG", "HEARTBEAT", "MISSION_ITEM", etc.
#
# For COMMAND_LONG, specify the command name:
#   - command: "MAV_CMD_COMPONENT_ARM_DISARM", "MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF", etc.
#
# Conditions can match on:
#   - param1-7: Parameter values
#   - system_id: Specific system ID
#   - component_id: Specific component ID
#
# Note: Messages that don't match any rule are forwarded immediately by default
# ============================================================================

# Delay ARM commands by 10 seconds
# (DISARM commands with param1=0.0 won't match this rule and pass through immediately)
